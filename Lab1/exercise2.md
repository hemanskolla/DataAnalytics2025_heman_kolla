# Exercise 2

- Completed all tasks detailed on the lab pdf. Chosen Variables: ECO.new & TCG.new from epi.data
- The instruction for the histogram was to overlay a theoretical probability distribution. For this, I overlayed a normal distribution given the variable's mean and standard deviation. Since doing 'rug' or a density curve have nothing to do with probability distributions, I left those commented.
- For the QQ Plot of the two chosen variables against each other, I used a 45 degree reference line instead of the reference line based on 'rnorm' in the provided code. Felt that this shows when the two distributions are similar, hence its standard use to compare two different distributions.
- Lastly, did the statistical tests with my chosen variables instead of 'rnorm'
