# Exercise 2

- Completed all tasks detailed on the lab pdf.
- The instruction for the histogram was to overlay a theoretical probability distribution. For this, I overlayed a normal distribution given the variable's mean and standard deviation. Since doing 'rug' or a density curve have nothing to do with probability distributions, I left those commented.
